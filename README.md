# CollaborativeProject1

This was an intersting project for me as a beginner.
The it doesn't looks technical and expertized, but i tell you this is just the begining.
my first time smearing my hands on Git, and sincerely I love it.
However still make your contributions cos its a learning process, make your remarks and criticism i will gladlly embrace them.
